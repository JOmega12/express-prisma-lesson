How to use the backend: 

-install express => npm i express

-then install nodemon for server => npm i nodemon

- to start nodemon => npx nodemon **filename** app.js



To Make your js into devdependency typescript ==> npm i --save-dev typescript

To make your typescript even tighter and install a tsconfig ==> npx tsc --init

To point the node to the file we care about instead of having to compile it: 
===> npm i --save-dev ts-node
THEN: npx ts-node src/app.ts



To add nodemon back to ts: 
add a nodemon.json file then add  this :

{
   "watch" : ["src"],
   "ext" : "ts",
   "exec" : "ts-node ./src/app.ts"
}

then run ==>  npx nodemon



TO PUT PRISMA INTO THE CODE:
- Go to prisma docs and follow the quickstart guide
- next on your schema.prisma, add your models. In this case, I put the model Character
- then on terminal put npx prisma migrate dev
   - this sets up the database and migration in dev.db
-then you can go on sqlite3 prisma/dev.db
